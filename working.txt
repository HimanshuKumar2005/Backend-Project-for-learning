1.used the npm init command to initialise the .json file
2.made a readme file
3.create a public folder ,but empty folder is not tracked by the github... so we add a gitkeep file inside it to be tracked..
4. Make a .gitignore file and take out the detail from gitignore generator for node..

5.make a .env file..that contains keys.. & secrets..
6.make a src folder & created .js file inside it..
7.Now add "type" : "module" in .json , so that the .js file will be treated as ES module instead of commonJS
8. Now install nodemon as dev-dependency.. so that the restarting problem can be overcomed.. using npm i -D nodemon command..
9.added a script "dev": "nodemon src/index.js" just to run
